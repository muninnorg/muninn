1. Introduction
---------------

Muninn is a software package for estimating generalized ensemble
weights in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The method is
full automated and makes use of the generalized multihistogram (GMH)
equations for estimation the density of states [1]. The package is
implemented in C++ and has a convenient interface.

A scientific article describing the method is currently in preparation
for publication.

The package is developed by Jes Frellsen and Jesper Ferkinghoff-Borg.

2. Documentation and manual
---------------------------

The Muninn code is documented using Doxygen and in-line comments. The
Doxygen documentation can be generated by running the command
'doxygen' for the Muninn root folder. The browsable html-documentation
will be made available online.

A manual for Muninn is in preparations.


3. Installation
---------------

The GNU build system (Autotools) is the preferred build systems for
Muninn, however CMake is also supported.

First the configure script has to be generated. If the Muninn root
folder already contains the script 'configure' you can skip this
step. The configure script is generated by running the script
autogen.sh in the Muninn root folder, that is

   ./autogen

When you have the configure script, Muninn can be build with the
following commands from the Muninn root folder

    ./configure
    make

After this Muninn can be installed on the system using the command

    make install


4. Supported systems
--------------------

Muninn has been compiled successfully on many different Linux
distributions and on Mac OS X. It compiles both with GCC (version
4.2.4 to 4.4.5 has been tested) and Intel compilers.
